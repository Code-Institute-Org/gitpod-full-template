                     My name is Jess Smyth.  I founded Skill Share in 2017 after struggling to find work. I had taken time out to raise a family.
                  When my daughter started pre-school I started looking for work.  I stumbled across a temporary job, part-time. After this, I didn't have another job for a full year. I didn't even get called for interviews.
                 Why was this so hard? I finally found a job through a family friend. I wondered how many others were in a similar position, but didn't have someone to make an introduction</p></div>

        About Skill Share</h2>
      <div class="flexsplit"> I'm Jessica Smyth and I founded Skill Share in 2017 after my struggle to find work. I had taken time out to raise a family.
               By the time my daughter was in pre-school I started looking for work.  I found a temporary job, part-time. After this, I didn't find anything else for a year. Not even a call for an interview. 
              I was educated and I had professional experience.
              what was the problem? I finally found a job through a family friend. I wondered 
              how many others were in a similar position, but didn't have someone to make an introduction?
    
      I wanted to help.
              <h2>My solution?</h2>
              A community Skill Sharing service. 
              A way to build networks and find opportunities. A way out. </p>
