        <span id="emphasis">just like you</span>
         Jessica and Sarah were two mothers struggling 
         to find work after raising a family. 
         Mark was unable to find anything 
         to get a foot on the ladder after a career break
          due to illness. We all had a higher education and experience - 
          but employers were wary of the 'gap'. 
          After lowering expectations and applying for jobs much lower 
          than what we were capable of, we found this didn't help either.
           We knew that we couldn't be the only ones who have faced this problem.   </h2></p> Our solution? </p>
        a community led skill sharing service, finding new opportunities to build experience and find meaningful employment.
        <p class="people">We have helped thousands re-enter work since 2004</p>
